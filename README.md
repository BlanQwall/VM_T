 Hello Benjamin and Bin, 
 If you can see this page, that means you have accepted to collaborate on the project. This is still private project that no one has access to but only the invited people. 
 You will not need to do anything. I will progressively purge the codes and render them into PDF. Some of these steps has alread been done. 
 The final project will be released to public once paper done.
