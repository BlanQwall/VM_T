# Description

For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)[@GSEA], the integrated data were used as expression dataset and clustering information was used as phenotype data to test the cluster 2 and rest of VMT or cluster 0. Normalized Enrichment Score (NES), FDR and nominal p-value were calculated with 100 permutations for testing MSigDB geneset) between samples from different phenotypes. 

> NOTICE: the intermediate files used as input for GSEA were not synchronized on the platform due to the size limit. However, these files could be generated in the following steps. 


# Preparation of data for GSEA

The following files were used as input for GSEA analyses: 

`AssayData_integrated_data_Zoom_memory_T.txt` - Exported expression matrix from `GetAssayData(object, slot = "data", assay = "RNA")` of Seurat package[@SeuratV4]. 

`Class_Zoom_memory_T_with_header.cls` - Class file generated from metadata of `SeuratObject@meta.data$seurat_clusters`

`geneRef.chip` - Gene reference file generated from CellRanger output `outs/raw_feature_bc_matrix/features.tsv.gz`

`<geneset>.gmt` - Geneset files download from ftp.broadinstitute.org


# Compare cluster 2 to REST with gene_sets in Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)

The following codes were used to launch each of GSEA analyses:

For a GSEA analysis with ${geneset}.gmt (downloaded from ${databasename} on the Broad Institut website. we use the following chunk: 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
